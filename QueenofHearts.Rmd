# Rules of the game

Players buy tickets, as many as they want, for $1 each and fill in
their names, phone numbers and the number, 1 to 54, of the card (or
joker) they want flipped. Every week, one and only one ticket is drawn
and the card---one of 54---is taped to a board with the corresponding
number flipped over. If itâ€™s the queen of hearts, the owner of the
ticket wins the pot. If not, the money stays in and the process starts
all over again the next week.

# Notation and Assumptions

Suppose there are \(k\) unflipped cards remaining on the board. Write \(m
= 54 - k\) for the number of weeks that the game has been played
without a winner.  Suppose you buy \(n\) tickets to play the game.
Suppose there are \(N\) tickets bought by other people also playing the
game.  Let \(J\) denote the current running jackpot carried over from
last week (before any new tickets were bought this week).

We assume that the deck of cards was well-shuffled before being placed
on the board.  We also assume that the pot of tickets was well-mixed
before selection of the one potential winning ticket.

Finally, we suppose that nobody has x-ray vision.


# Location of the Queen of Hearts

After \(m\) weeks of lost games, the Queen of Hearts is equally likely
to be located at any one of the remaining \(k\) cards.  To see why, let
\(X\) denote the random location of the Queen of Hearts.  When \(k = 54\),
then \(\Pr(X=x) = 1/54\), \(x = 1,2,\ldots,54\) since the deck was
well-shuffled.  Suppose in week one the chosen ticket was \(x_{1}\), and
suppose that ticket was a loser.  Given the information \(X \neq
x_{1}\), the conditional distribution of \(X\) is \[ \Pr(X =
x\,\vert\,X\neq x_{1}) = \frac{\Pr(X = x)}{\Pr(X \neq x_{1})} =
\frac{1/54}{53/54} = \frac{1}{53},\quad x = 1,2,\ldots,54,\quad x \neq
x_{1}.  \] Continuing in this fashion, \[ \Pr(X = x\,\vert\,X\neq
x_{1},\ldots,x_{m}) = \frac{\Pr(X = x)}{\Pr(X \neq
x_{1},\ldots,x_{m})} = \frac{1/54}{(54 - m)/54} = \frac{1}{k},\quad x
= 1,2,\ldots,54,\quad x \neq x_{1},\ldots,x_{m}.  \]


# Probability that somebody wins this week</h2>

There is a 100% chance that somebody's ticket will be selected.  That
ticket will have a number on it, and that number will match the random
location of the Queen of Hearts a proportion \(1/k\) of the time\(\ldots\)
no x-ray vision, remember? That means \[ \Pr(\text{Somebody wins}) =
\Pr(\text{Number matches}) = \frac{1}{k}.  \]

# Probability that *you* win this week 

There are \(N + n\) total tickets in the pot, \(n\) of which with your
name on it.  Assuming a well-mixed pot, the probability that one of
your tickets is selected is \[ \Pr(\text{Your ticket selected}) =
\frac{n}{N + n}.  \] Given that your ticket is selected, you have
probability \(\Pr(\text{Number matches}) = 1/k\) that your number
matches. Therefore, the probability that you win is \[ \Pr(\text{You
win})= \Pr(\text{Your ticket selected} \cap \text{Number matches}) =
\frac{n}{k(N + n)}.  \]


# Odds against your winning 

If we write \(p = \frac{n}{N + n} \cdot \frac{1}{k}\) then \[\text{Odds
against you} = \frac{1 - p}{p} = \frac{kN + (k - 1)n}{n}. \]


# Probability that the game lasts this long

The game ends exactly when somebody wins, and we saw earlier that when
there are \(k\) tickets left, the probability that somebody wins is \(1/k\).
Let \(L\) denote the length of the game.  Then \(L\) can be any number
\(1,2,\ldots,54\).  But \(\Pr(L = 1)\) is \[ \Pr(L = 1) = \Pr( \text{Somebody wins
when }k\text{ is 54}) = \frac{1}{54}.  \] Now, in order for \(L = 2\) it
must be that nobody wins the first week (with probability \(53/54\)),
and then somebody wins the second week (with probability \(1/53\)).
Thus \[ \Pr(L = 2) = \frac{53}{54}\cdot \frac{1}{53} = \frac{1}{54}.
\] By the same reasoning, \[ \Pr(L = 3) = \frac{53}{54}\cdot
\frac{52}{53} \cdot \frac{1}{52} = \frac{1}{54}, \] and so forth.  In other
words, the outcomes \(L = 1,2,3,\ldots,54\) are equally likely.
 
 
With the above in mind, we may ask questions like, "What are the
chances the game will continue until there are at most 7 cards left?"
This is \[ \Pr(L \geq 48) = \frac{7}{54} \approx 0.1296296, \] or
almost a 13% chance.

# It lasted this long, how much longer? 

Given that the game has lasted \(m\) weeks, the location of the Queen of
Hearts is uniformly distributed on the remaining \(k\) cards, so the
same argument above carries through except now our deck has only \(k\)
cards in it.  For instance, given that there are \(k = 7\) cards left,
then the probability that the game keeps going until there are at most
2 cards remaining is \(2/7 \approx 0.2857143\).
 
 
# Expected winnings 

Suppose you only started playing the game this week.  Denote your
winnings by \(W\), where we understand that if you lose then your
winnings are negative.  You spent \(\$n\) on tickets, but you will
have \(\$(J + N + n)\) if you win.  Your expected winnings are \[
\mathbb{E}(W) = -n \Pr(\text{Lose}) + (J + N + n)\Pr(\text{Win}), \]
and after plugging in the formulas from above we get \[ \mathbb{E}(W)
= -n \left( 1 - \frac{n}{k(N + n)}\right) + (J + N + n)\left(
\frac{n}{k(N + n)} \right). \]

# But what if I played earlier weeks, too? 

Let's say you bought \(n^{\ast}\) tickets prior to this week's game.
Then after your \(n\) tickets this week you've invested \(n + n^{\ast}\)
total dollars in the game which you stand to lose.  The \(n^{\ast}\) is
already contained in the \(J\) dollars above, because that money carries
through from week to week.  Your probability of winning this week
doesn't change.  Your (smaller) expected winnings are \[ \mathbb{E}(W)
= -(n + n^{\ast}) \left( 1 - \frac{n}{k(N + n)}\right) + (J + N +
n)\left( \frac{n}{k(N + n)} \right). \]

# Expected winnings per dollar 

Just divide \(\mathbb{E}(W)\) by \(n\), or \((n + n^{\ast})\), whatever your
case may be.

# Can I try it out? 

Sure.  <a href="https://gjkerns.shinyapps.io/QueenOfHearts">Here is an RStudio web application</a> that calculates (almost) all
of the above for assorted values of \(k\), \(n\), \(N\), and \(J\).
